## Design Process

### Target Audience

This website is designed for guests who loves music and bands who would like to practice together in a studio. The target audience consists of people who need to prepare for shows or just to relax at a place filled with music.

### User Goals

The primary goals of the users are:

- want to practice as a band
- want to practice their own instrument(s)
- wants to compose music
- want to relax and eat without harsh noises

### How the Project Helps Achieve These Goals

This project is designed to address the user's needs by providing:

- able to book a studio online so there is no need to wait on the day itself at non-priority queue
- instruments are provided as some instruments are too big & heavy to carry arround
- has a recording room in the studio so musicians can use the instrument while composing music
- able to reserve a table online so there is no need to queue at non-priority line

### User Stories

1. As a member of Eternity, I would want to have a fix studio to practice with my leader and my other members
2. As a person who loves music, I want to enjoy all sort of music provided in the café, so i could relax without any disturbance.
3. As a pianist, I want to play my piano in a place where no one can hear me playing, so I can focus more on my playing.
